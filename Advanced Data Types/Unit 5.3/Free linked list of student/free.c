// In this task you will continue working on the linked list of students in which you would 
// like to store, for each student, their name and age. As before you are provided with some 
// code that you should not modify.

// Your current task is to write a function freeStudents() which takes as input a pointer that 
// holds the address of the start of a linked list of students. Your function should then free 
// the space allocated for each student in this list of students. Your function should not return 
// anything.
