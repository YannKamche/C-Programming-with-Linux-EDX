// You ask your students to write a program with source code stored in vizplus.c and 
// which uses the JPEG library. In order to help your students you decide to print out 
// the compilation command for them that creates an executable file called vizplus from 
// vizplus.c along with linking the JPEG library during the translation process. 

// Please write a program that prints the necessary compilation command with a simple 
// printf(). Again, your students' source code is provided in vizplus.c. You only need 
// to link the JPEG library and produce an executable file called vizplus.
