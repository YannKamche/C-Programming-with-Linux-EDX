// You are grading final exams and you are recording grades (integers) in a file "myGrades.txt". 
// You just got distracted by a phone call and can't remember whether or not you already recorded 
// the grade of the student whose paper you just finished grading.

// Expecting that this may not be the last time your phone rings you decide to write a C-program 
// to help you out. The program should first read, from the user input, the grade (an integer) 
// that you need to check on. Next, the program should open the file "myGrades.txt", find the last 
// number in the file, close the file, and compare the last number from the file to the grade read 
// from the user input. If the two grades are equal then you presumably already recorded the grade 
// and don't have to do anything. If on the other hand the two grades do not equal each other then 
// you have not yet recorded this new grade and need to do so by appending this new grade to the 
// file.

// Finally, reopen the file and print its new contents to the screen.
