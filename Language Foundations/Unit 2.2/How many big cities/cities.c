/*
You want to determine the number of cities in a given region that have a population strictly greater than 10,000. To do this, you write a program that first reads the number of cities in a region as an integer, and then the populations for each city one by one (also integers).

Example
Input
6
1000
5000
15000
4780
0
23590
Output
